# Cansat GCS Readme

Welcome to the Cansat Ground Control Station (GCS) repository! This project is developed for the Cansat mission organized by NASA and AAS (American Astronomical Society).

## About Cansat Mission

The Cansat mission is an exciting competition where teams are challenged to design, build, and launch a simulation of a satellite called a "Cansat." The mission aims to provide students with hands-on experience in aerospace engineering and space science. Participants work in teams to create a miniature satellite that fits inside a soda can and performs various tasks during a simulated space mission.

## About Cansat GCS

The Cansat GCS is a vital component of the Cansat mission, serving as the control center for monitoring and controlling the Cansat during the mission. This repository contains the code and resources for the Ground Control Station software, allowing users to interact with the Cansat and retrieve data in real-time.


## Features

- **Dashboard:** The Dashboard provides a summarized view of the current state of the mission in 6 steps. It displays information such as the current time, mission time, and the ability to connect to the Cansat's radio Xbee for data communication through the serial port.

- **Simulation Control Page:** The Simulation Control Page allows users to execute simulation commands. It includes features such as loading simulation data, starting simulation mode, and stopping simulation mode.

- **Telemetry View Page:** The Telemetry View Page provides a live display of telemetry data in the form of a table. Users can monitor real-time information such as altitude, temperature, humidity, GPS coordinates, and more.

- **Telemetry Plotted Data:** The Telemetry Plotted Data page allows users to visualize telemetry data in real-time through interactive plots. It provides a dynamic and graphical representation of the collected data, enabling users to analyze and interpret the Cansat's performance during the mission.

The Dashboard page offers an intuitive and comprehensive overview of the mission's current state. It presents the mission progress in six steps, allowing users to quickly assess the progress and status of the Cansat. Additionally, the Dashboard provides the functionality to establish a connection to the Cansat's radio Xbee via the serial port, facilitating data communication between the GCS and the Cansat.

On the Simulation Control Page, users can easily manage and control the simulation process. They can load simulation data to replicate different mission scenarios, start the simulation mode to initiate the simulated mission, and stop the simulation mode when necessary.

The Telemetry View Page presents live telemetry data in a structured table format, providing real-time information on various parameters collected by the Cansat. Users can monitor critical data such as altitude, temperature, humidity, GPS coordinates, and more, enabling them to stay informed about the Cansat's performance during the mission.

For in-depth analysis and visualization of telemetry data, the Telemetry Plotted Data page offers interactive and real-time plots. Users can explore different data sets and generate graphical representations to gain insights into the Cansat's behavior and performance over time. This feature enhances the ability to analyze and interpret telemetry data effectively.

By incorporating these pages into the Cansat GCS, users can have a comprehensive and user-friendly experience throughout the mission, enabling efficient monitoring, control, and analysis of the Cansat's performance.
